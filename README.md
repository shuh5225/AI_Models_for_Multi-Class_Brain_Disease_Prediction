# AI_Models_for_Multi-Class_Brain_Disease_Prediction
This project focuses on the performance evaluation of various Machine Learning models for the classification and analysis of different brain diseases. The primary goal is to compare multiple ML algorithms and identify their effectiveness based on different evaluation parameters rather than relying solely on accuracy.
